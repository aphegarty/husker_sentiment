I really like Dexter Moody. We had him rated the #147 player in the 2009 class. He was being recruited by some schools as a SS, but mostly as a WILL. From the tape I have on him from his H.S. days, the kid's strengths and style are made for Pelini's system. I do feel like he would rather play in the south, though. One interesting thing about Moody is that he is a December grad, so that benefits Nebraska some. The idea being he has to make his decision earlier than normal, thus less chance he gets a more appealing offer from an SEC/ACC team (theoretically).",2010-08-04T19:08:32Z,"

If Aaron Green decides to play for Nebraska or Florida State or someone  other  than Texas, it will mean they were his  first  choice - not that Texas wanted Malcolm Brown more. Believe me, if Aaron Green wants to play for Texas, he will play for Texas. Mack Brown may prefer Malcolm Brown more overall, but he wont say no to Green in addition. Too good to pass up. Aaron Green is truly one of the special players in the 2010 class. IMO Green is one of the top 5 overall playmakers , regardless of position. No school in the country, no matter how many spots they have open or position they may prefer to use that scholarship on, is going to say no to Aaron Green choosing to attend their school. Not Florida, not Alabama, not Texas.",2010-08-12T21:45:23Z,"

As for committing, all I was trying to say was that if playing with his brother was as important as some think he would have committed by now, so obviously there is more to it than hos brother.  His brother here at Nu does give us an edge that no one else has, but that is obviously not a gaurentee of a commit.

The reason that Texas is not full-court pressing Aaron Green is beacuse the Longhorns are pretty deep and young at RB and they would  prefer  to only bring in one more RB in this class. They must either feel they have a better overall chance at landing Malcolm Brown than Aaron Green, or they simply prefer Brown to Green. Heck, they may be going harder after Brown because they feel Green is a Husker lean?

The point is that their class only has 2 or 3 spots left and when you are a school like Texas and you are capable of recruiting anyone, anywhere, you have the luxery of spending the majority of your time trying to secure a commitment from someone at a more desired position. They can play hardball with kids because they know that they can replace a 5* or 4* player who says 'No' with a fellow 5* or 4* player. Most schools outside of Florida, USC (until recently), Alabama and a select few others can pull this off. Texas can.",2010-08-13T18:20:36Z,"

That they do. But he is also the same coordinator that has coached Ricky Williams, Cedric Benson, and Jamaal Charles who are now putting up yards in the NFL. Texas is always having to tweak the system to fit the personnel. Vince Young wasn't going to run the same type system as Applewhite or Simms or even McCoy. The staff is moving toward a downfield running game with Gilbert relying more on playaction passing and getting the ball downfield. I definitely think this year the offense will see some growing pains with a new qb and some youth on the line. The first couple months the running game could be ugly. Maybe not. I do think a lot of the downhill running game philosophy is part of Muschamp starting to put his print on the program.

Yeah I just find it interesting with Cash that he would even consider looking around unless he isn't hearing what he wants to hear or OSU is telling him to look around due to class size or something (which I kinda doubt based on his skill). I won't consider your prediction wild if he chooses to come here! ;) The great thing I keep reading about Cash and Lyons is how they are both rover types with the ability to play S - uhm, sounds exactly like the abilities BP is lookin for! 

Also I haven't seen as much video on Mickey as I have on Peat, so I'm a little biased here, but Peat fires off the ball like mad and seems to be in the backfield more than he isn't. Based on rankings, I would assume Mickey is darn good and we should hope to get him as well - he seems to be in the Jay Guy mold (continually described as a tank).

Yeah, all of this is just speculation and I'm no mind-reader, but everything I've read on Hobbi just makes it seem like he wants to stay in the SW. Once again, hope I'm wrong, but we've got a good looking OLine class so far!",2010-08-26T21:02:47Z,"

I think he did not want to be rushed so he told Texas he was going to take his time and decide.  I think Texas wanted to take 2 RB, #1 being Brown and #2 blieve one of 3 or 4 other backs which included Green.  One of those """"""""other"""""""" backs committed to Texas.  Green than may have wanted to but was told the spot is Brown's first, so he had to first wait on Brown.  Then after Brown committed, Green narrows his list to 2-3 school Cal, NU and FSU.  I think Texas has targets for the last 1 or 2 schollie thay have and come late January if Texas does not get those targets they will make a hard pusj for Green...and then that is when we see where he real wants to go.  I think if Texas completely fills up before Late January we will see Green commit somewhere shorty after that, but I think he is waiting to see how the Texas scholie numbers play out.

I hope he chooses NU, but right now I still think we are in the group of second choices along with Cal and FSU.
