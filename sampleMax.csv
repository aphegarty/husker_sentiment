If you were an Alltel customer, they had a thing called AxcessMyPics.com where you could send pictures from your phone to the site. It still works with the switch to Verizon and I bet most of the major phone companies use something similar. Then you just copy properties and paste it here the usual way.

Not really a decomit per-se (as the article title suggests) as the offer was pulled....he was """"let go"""" by Nebraska for not meeting certain conditions of his offer....his offer was conditonal on how he performed at camp etc.....he was the lowest rated of our O-line commits....a good kid who I wish the very best too....has an offer from Kansas.....hope it works out for him....:)


[QUOTE]College football recruiting should be followed at one's own risk. Get too interested and invested, and it will burn you. Verbal commitments aren't binding. Frankly, kids change their minds. The latest example is Nebraska offensive line prospect Dylan Admire. [B]After initially picking the Huskers, Admire is now seeking a chance for earlier playing time. He has told Rivals.com that he will be re-opening his recruiting process, essentially decommiting from Nebraska. [/B]

Admire had initially picked Nebraska back in February, making him one of the earlier players to pledge to NU. Since then, the Huskers have added four other talented offensive linemen to their class. Admire - who holds scholorship offers from several Big 12 schools - will open his recruiting back up and evaluate his best options.

The loss is disappointing for the Huskers. Any time at team takes a """"loss"""" in recruiting, there has to be a bit of a negative feeling. The offensive line is considered by many to be the position of most need for NU in this class. It remains to be seen if Nebraska will fill Admire's slot with another offensive lineman or stand pat with the four they have in the fold now. [/QUOTE]

Great, thanks for the info. Here's what I found on him:

Rivals.com Rankings:
Position: 2
National: 72
State: 2

This from Rivals' Barry Every:
[QUOTE][B]On the Hoof[/B]: Hobbi has wide shoulders, thick arms and the chest of a serious weightlifter. Hobbi has very little bad body weight and adding another 20 pounds wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be a problem. His physique is similar to Notre Dame offensive guard Chris Watt. 
[B]Needs Improvement[/B]: He is fairly lean right now and could use some extra weight for run blocking. Hobbi also thinks he is an offensive tackle, but his arms are not long enough so he will need to learn how to play inside. 
[B]Most Impressive[/B]: Hobbi looks very natural getting into his pass set and understands the importance of hand placement. He does a nice job of moving his feet while engaged with a defender. His body type looks very versatile as he could easily play center, guard and perhaps right offensive tackle. 
[B]Conclusion[/B]: This tough offensive lineman has what it takes to become a three-year starter. He backs down to no one and is very athletic for the position.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE][url]http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/footbal...n=ncaaf-258719[/url]

Without anyone explicitly saying so, it's a good bet that Brown never wanted to leave Kansas in the first place. His older brother, Arthur, followed a similar trajectory, shipping out for two unremarkable seasons in Miami before transferring home to Kansas State  in March. Bryce is likely to follow that prodigal path, if he can find the initiative and/or nerve to actually secure his release from Tennessee.[/QUOTE]Based on the situation with Scott Criss, can't he enroll at KSU with out a release and then talk with the coaches and perhaps get put on scholarship should KSU want to and have one available?  It sounds like the issue is you can't talk to other coaches until you are released, however, if you enroll on your own and pay your own way (at least the first tuition payment) then you can talk to the coaches at the new school even if you don't have a release.",3221,visible,0,9,0,a:0:{},0,,1280372682,19,1

[QUOTE]Just got off the phone with David Santos' head coach, Drew Svoboda.

Svoboda said Santos led Klein Collins High in tackles last season as the Tigers finished 12-1, losing in the third round of the Class 5A state playoffs.

“He just has a knack to play the game of football,” the coach said. “That’s probably what separates David from a lot of other high school athletes. He has an extremely high football I.Q.

“The second thing is his suddenness at the point of contact. He’s extremely fast-twitched. He has a lot of pop to him.”

Utah, which thoroughly recruits the Houston area, was the first to offer Santos a scholarship, Svoboda said. 

Mike Ekeler evidently did an excellent job in landing Santos.

“Coach Ekeler’s an extremely intense guy, and it comes across in his recruiting,” Svoboda said. """"David's everything you want in a recruit, and I think Coach Ekeler saw that immediately.""""[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]David Santos, a 6-foot, 193-pound linebacker from Klein, Texas, has committed to Nebraska, according to both Scout.com and Rivals.com.

He reportedly turned down scholarship offers from Arkansas, Colorado State, Kansas, Memphis, Tulane, Utah and Wyoming.

""""The academics were big,"""" Santos told Scout.com's Bryan Munson. """"The 94 percent graduation rate is good. I am going there and will play for a good football school. But I will also take care of the academics.

""""Football wise, it's just a great fit. I love the defense. I love the coaching staff. It was just a big family there.""""

Nebraska linebackers coach Mike Ekeler apparently played the lead role in Santos' recruitment.

Chaminade-Madonna: Football on the rise again
 
South Florida Sun-Sentinel
June 14, 2010


HOLLYWOOD — Tim Tyrell has always built his defense around speed and this year's squad will be no different.

""""We're never very big. Last year people would laugh when they saw our defensive front, there wasn't anyone over 180 pounds, but these guys are quick and they get to the ball in a hurry,"""" the third-year Chaminade-Madonna football coach said. """"This is South Florida, everybody down here is fast, for us it's just a matter of the kids buying into the system. We like to play speed with speed.""""

[B]Last season it was the Lions who usually had the last laugh as they posted six shutouts before finally falling in a 7-6 struggle with Tampa Catholic in a Class 2B state semifinal game. They finished the season 12-1.[/B]

The Lions graduated 19 seniors last season, including linebacker Ruben Narcisse (44 tackles, six sacks and three blocked punts) one of the county's best.

Tyrell will be looking to senior linebacker Kevin Galvez to fill that void, and so far this spring he's """"really stepped up"""" in doing just that.

Tyrell also expects more big things from [B]Curt Evans (6-0, 175, WR/DB[/B]) and Chris Washington, a sophomore defensive back who's had a """"really good spring."""" Washington saw some varsity time last year after performing well on the JV squad.

Other secondary standouts include Mike DeSanti (5-11, 170) and Brian Cooney (5-11, 160).

On offense, the Lions will be led by senior quarterback Jerrard Randall, who was named Second Team All State after passing for 1,593 yards and rushing for 1,074 while scoring 37 total touchdowns (19 rushing, 18 passing).

Randall should have some nice targets in Evans (643 yards and 11 TDs last year) and senior Jonathan Aiken (5-11, 180).

Tyrell said Randall's hard work from a mental standpoint is what truly separates him from other quarterbacks in the state.

""""He studies the game as a quarterback a lot more than people think. He loves film work, and he's always going over coverages with his quarterback coach, always trying to get better,"""" Tyrell said.

Randall has received offers from Florida, Florida State, Michigan, Ohio State and LSU and is rated the fourth best quarterback in the state (39th best athlete overall) on Florida High School Football's Super 75 list.

He is also a finalist for the Steve Clarkson Super Seven quarterback academy, an elite camp in which the seven best high school quarterbacks in the nation participate.

Tyrell has also had his team start a new workout regimen with Pete Bommarito, who's trained former Chaminade and UM standout linebacker Jon Beason and former Miami Dolphin, Zach Thomas.

""""That's been great for the kids, learning this different style of working out from a guy who usually works with NFL guys,"""" Tyrell said.

But does Chaminade have enough to make another run to states?

""""The goal is to improve upon last year. It takes a lot of luck to get back there,"""" Tyrell said. """"If we can stay healthy and just get through the season, who knows? We hope we'll be playing at a state championship level, but we're still just trying to get through the summer and two-a-days. We've still got a long way to go."""" [/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]LINCOLN â€” Will Nebraskaâ€™s 2011 jump to the Big Ten hurt NU recruiting in Texas? 

No, says Drew Svoboda. 

And Svoboda is in a position to know. 

The Nebraska native is the coach at Klein Collins High School, a 5-A power just northwest of Houston â€” the center of perhaps the nationâ€™s most concentrated pool of prep football talent. Svoboda coaches linebacker David Santos, the latest incoming senior to accept an NU scholarship offer â€” and notably, the first Texan to jump on board since NU announced its departure from the Big 12 in June. 

The conference switch was largely lauded, though some wondered if it might limit Nebraskaâ€™s visibility in Texas. The Huskers will no longer travel south for league games or appear on regional TV programming around Dallas or Houston. 

No big deal, according to Svoboda. 

â€œRemember, this is a pretty big state,â€ the coach said. â€œIt takes me 10 hours to get to Lubbock. I can get to Iowa in 10 hours. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a selling point for a Texas kid that if you go to Nebraska (as a Big 12 school), youâ€™re going to play maybe two out of 13 games in your home state. 

â€œPeople are going to make an issue out of this, but thatâ€™s all it is â€” something the media wants to create.â€ 

The current NU roster includes 26 players from Texas high schools. 

Svoboda was born and spent nearly 12 years in Fremont, Neb. Most of his extended family remains around Omaha, Lincoln and Columbus. 

Heâ€™s also an important ally for NU smack in the middle of a recruiting hotbed. 

The 33-year-old coach, entering his third season at Klein Collins, guided the school to a 12-1 finish last fall and a semifinal berth in the big-school playoffs. For it, the Houston Texans named him the 5-A coach of the year. 

Heâ€™s 18-4 in two seasons after the school won just five of 30 games before his arrival in 2008. 

And he knows all about the Huskers. 

â€œBeing a high school coach in my position with 80 to 90 college assistants coming through here every spring, itâ€™s kind of hard to still be a fan,â€ Svoboda said. â€œBut my role in recruiting is to share information with my players. I donâ€™t feel like I ever want to sway somebody. Theyâ€™re the ones who have to play there.â€ 

That said, Svoboda discussed the Nebraska lifestyle with Santos, who visited Lincoln with his family last month before reaching a decision. Santos had offers from Arkansas, Kansas and Utah, among others, but Svoboda said he thought that the linebacker would fall for the Huskers. 

â€œIt fits his personality,â€ the coach said. 

Again, he speaks from experience. 

Svoboda walked on at Nebraska in 1995 out of Tomball, Texas. He filled the role of a grayshirt before such a practice was common, sitting out that fall with the intention of starting work in the spring of 1996 as a true freshman. 

Instead, he transferred near home to Division I-AA Stephen F. Austin and started at fullback for three years. But Svoboda recalls his semester in Lincoln fondly. 

Svobodaâ€™s coaching influences, understandably, were formed more as a result of his time at S.F. Austin, where Auburn coach Gene Chizik, formerly of Iowa State and Texas, served as defensive coordinator. But like any blossoming football minds who spent time around Tom Osborne in his prime, Svoboda learned from the former NU coach. 

â€œIâ€™m pretty well schooled in what Nebraska football is all about and the importance of football in that state,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s what I communicated to David, and I think David figured it out in a hurry.â€ 

Svoboda describes Santos as â€œa fine young man.â€ Heâ€™s the 13th pledge for the NU class of 2011, which includes three Texans among a group that will hold a spot in Nebraska history as the first batch of true freshmen in the Big Ten era. 

â€œHeâ€™s not a big talker,â€ Svoboda said, â€œbut heâ€™s really able to flip the switch. When he steps on that football field, heâ€™s going to step it up to a whole new level.â€ 

While discussing the Huskers, Svoboda mentioned that he coached another player last year whose name might resound within Nebraska: JaMichael Rozier, the son of Husker Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier. 

The younger Rozier rushed for some 1,700 yards at Klein Collins last year but picked a scholarship from Prairie View A&M over NUâ€™s walk-on offer. [/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]Want the latest on Nebraska's 2011 recruiting class? Jamal Turner might be your best source.

The highly regarded quarterback, from Arlington, Texas, has been following the status of prospective teammates ever since he made an oral commitment last January. And so far, he likes what he sees.

“We're turning out to be a good class,” Turner said. “It's looking good.”

Of course, lately Turner's been doing more than simply monitoring the growing group of 2011 NU commitments (the total's at 13 now). He's trying to become student of the game.

He always keeps his eye on most recent recruiting news, though. He knows that he and several others have been getting good reviews.

[B]Last week, Rivals.com updated its list of the top 2011 Texas recruits. Turner's No. 20. San Antonio running back Aaron Green, a Nebraska target, is No. 3.[/B]

[B]Maybe the biggest surprise on the list is cornerback Tevin Mitchel, from just outside of the Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex. He's is No. 13.[/B]

[B]Remember, the 6-foot, 175-pounder had just a couple scholarship offers heading into the spring. But since then, he's blossomed into a big-time target. Mitchel is No. 6 on the Rivals.com list of top cornerbacks.[/B]

Turner says Mitchel's the real deal.

“Tevin, I promise you, he's going to be one of the best corners in state,” he said.

And as for Bubba Starling? Turner doesn't mind that there's another quarterback in Nebraska's class.

“A lot of people asked me about Bubba Starling,” Turner said. “Everybody asks me about him. I don't really care too much. I'm ready to compete.” [/QUOTE]

93121,4401,268,Red Reign,1281112255,"A short synopsis as to where we are at in recruiting....:)

[QUOTE]When you look at where Nebraska sits in recruiting, you see they've done a lot of the meat and potatoes work. They have 5 linemen committed for 2011 (4 offensive, one defensive). In addition, they've got four defensive backs, two quarterbacks, a placekicker, and a linebacker. [B]So what do they do with the remaining 6-8 scholarships that they'll have to offer? It appears they'll want pass-catchers, ball carriers, and pass-rushers - the fun stuff.[/B]

If you follow sites like Rivals.com and Scout.com, it appears the Huskers have offers out to at least seven running backs. Aaron Green (brother of current Huskers defensive back Andrew Green) is the name everyone seems to know, but there are a number of highly touted backs in their sights. Then there are at least a couple dozen wide receivers they've offered. Several of them are hot properties. The Huskers continue to seek offensive line help and still have offers out to a half dozen prospects. 

There are as many as 11 linebackers still holding offers. So the recent commitment of David Santos probably doesn't end their hunt for good young linebacking help. Likewise, there still are 13 offers out to defensive backs. Not to mention another seven defensive tackles. There are 11 defensive ends with offers, and presumably the Huskers would seek at least two. 

Surprisingly, only three tight ends have offers. Considering two seniors are leaving and Chase Harper's arrival will at a minimum be delayed, you might have expected them being more aggressive at that spot. 

Once practices commence, recruiting talk will fade into the background, [B]but don't be surprised to see the Huskers hone in on playmaking positions from this point onwards.[/B][/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]Scouting Report on Cyrus Hobbi

[B]On the Hoof[/B]: Hobbi has wide shoulders, thick arms and the chest of a serious weightlifter. Hobbi has very little bad body weight and adding another 20 pounds won't be a problem. His physique is similar to Notre Dame offensive guard Chris Watt. 

[B]Needs Improvement:[/B] He is fairly lean right now and could use some extra weight for run blocking. Hobbi also thinks he is an offensive tackle, but his arms are not long enough so he will need to learn how to play inside. 

[B]Most Impressive[/B]: Hobbi looks very natural getting into his pass set and understands the importance of hand placement. He does a nice job of moving his feet while engaged with a defender. His body type looks very versatile as he could easily play center, guard and perhaps right offensive tackle. 

[B]Conclusion:[/B] This tough offensive lineman has what it takes to become a three-year starter. He backs down to no one and is very athletic for the position.[/QUOTE]

I really don't understand a lot of kids not qualifying...  IMO, you really have to work (or rather not work) at not qualifying.  Kids are usually identified as being college football material by the eighth grade.  High School coaches, especially at football powers, tend to be on top of or force the kids to be on top of academics.  Yet some kids apparently just do not make the serious effort...  and the GPA is in core academic classes only...  So they really need to get a C or better in Algebra, Geometry, Sciences, etc.

I tend to be real skeptical of kids who can't qualify.  I am highly skeptical of their work ethic.  A lot of the border line prospects I have seen in the area over the years who don't qualify never do...  If they go to JUCOs most drop out...

You cannot have a good walk-on program without awarding scholarships to walk-ons.  I'd argue we should award 3 or 4 per year.

Here is why I think the NCAA regs have unintentionally contributed to the problem...  they should allow much more in the way of summer programs/camps for evaluating talent (I noticed virtually every school had theirs at the same week... Is this per NCAA regs?)

[QUOTE]6. Oversigning doesn't create a competitive advantage so what's the big deal.

This couldn't be any further from the truth, especially within the last several years.  [B]Over the last several years the ability for coaches to evaluate players has decreased; the NCAA continues to decrease the amount of contact coaches can have with players (mainly out of fear of recruiting violations) which is making it hard for them to evaluate talent.  In addition, the NCAA continues to place more and more restrictions on the amount of time coaches can spend with players during spring and fall training camps and during the off season. The  net result is college football has become less about developing talent and more about mining for the next """"sure thing"""" 5 star recruit.  [/B]

When you oversign you have access to more opportunities to find that """"sure thing"""" whether it be from landing a 5 star recruit or taking a chance on a borderline guy who turns out to be a stud.  It's a numbers game and obviously, given that most of the top tier schools can attract top tier talent, the more of it that you can go through to find the ones you really want the better you will be.

Nick Saban and Les Miles have used oversigning as the backbone of building National Championship teams over the last decade.  If you look at the chart below and look at the number of players signed by Saban (who had the highest average) and Tressel (who had the lowest average), in the years that Saban was in college football he signed roughly 193 recruits; Tressel signed roughly 142 in those same years.  That is a difference of 51 recruiting opportunities over the same period of time.  Any change there might be a couple more good players in that list of 51?  If the difference were 5-10 I don't think we could point at this being an issue, but 51?[/QUOTE]Also... Tressel at 142 signees vs. Miles at193...

Well, we technically oversigned big this past year, starting out with a recruiting budget of something like 12 scholarships before fall camp and ending up with 22-23 signees, but some attrition was definitely expected in year 2.  
 
We will find ourselves in a similar position next year with 12 JR's on the roster and no scholarships to speak of to give to walk-ons to normalize that number somewhat. We are sitting at +1 right now with Heard not making it.  We can give that to a SR walk-on this year, but that's all we have barring any unforseen defections at this point.
 
 
Bo has done a fantastic job of rebuilding and managing the roster and position groups, but in the strict """"oversigning"""" definition used by that website, he's also guilty of oversigning due to the roster mess he was left with....certainly not anywhere close to the extent that Nutt or Miles have in recent years.  Our staff is very picky about the academic side of things, it seems, so we will not sign many players that are in danger of NQ.

[B]N2FL:  What do you view as some of your playing strengths?[/B] 
  
[B]D.W.:[/B]  My strength, motor and tackling ability.

[B]N2FL:  How would you feel about Redshirting?[/B] 
  
[B]D.W.:[/B]  I don't want to redshirt. I want to get on the field as quick as possible.

[QUOTE]Q: What is the story on Aaron Green? I've heard that UT is still pursuing him, yet I read quotes from him that he hasn't heard from UT in a while.

A: Many people feel that Texasâ€™s interest in Green is directly contrary to the Longhornsâ€™ interest in Malcolm Brown. With two running backs in the past class in Demarco Cobbs and Traylon Shead, and with a big back in Joe Bergeron already committed for 2011, Texas will likely only take one back with its final three openings. With Texas sitting in a strong position for Brown, the Longhorns appear to have backed off Green a bit.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE][B]Malcolm Brown[/B]
Odds of Committing: 105% — extra 5% boost to sway the doubters.
This one’s locked and loaded and don’t let anyone tell you differently. Brown notified the staff weeks ago that he’s Austin bound. We’ve had two different sources close the program confirm as such, including the one that gave us the ASJ prediction and the news of Rasco visiting this past weekend, which scooped all other media outlets foreign and domestic. Time to ask for a $10 refund for the month of August from your preferred pay wall site. Seriously, ask them!

We anticipate Brown to commit before school starts and our five years of wandering the desert giving offers to RB mirages hoping they’d bear 6’1 / 210 / 4.4 fruit will finally be over soon. 

[B]Aaron Green[/B]
Odds of Committing: 5% — still a long shot.

If Brown chooses the Horns, the percentages are virtually nil for a Green commitment. The Horns have needs at other positions even if ASJ opens up another ship. We’re guessing Green’s spot goes to a corner like Charles Jackson, a player that emerges late in the process with a huge senior year, or an OOS five star caliber player that has contacted the staff to get an indication of interest. Yes, that’s happened. Do they end up in Austin? No. But we’ll generally flirt back.

Another thing the staff is cognizant of is depth chart concerns for the super blue running back prospects in the 2012 class. Jonathan Gray and Barry Sanders, Jr. are high on the staff’s priority lists for next season and they feel that both of these players are better all around backs than Green. [/QUOTE]

I never said I KNOW he wants to play for Texas I said it was my opinion that he does.  As for what NF2L said, (again my opinion and I am not an expert by any means, ...nor do I play one on TV nor did I sleep at a Holiday Inn Express last night :D and I am sure that most readers of this thread will put more stock into yours and NF2L's opinions that mine and that is fine with me) if Texas wanted him because he is too good to pass up Brown or not then why would they cool off on recruiting him?   

As for committing, all I was trying to say was that if playing with his brother was as important as some think he would have committed by now, so obviously there is more to it than hos brother.  His brother here at Nu does give us an edge that no one else has, but that is obviously not a gaurentee of a commit.

I do not claim to know what Mr. Green is thinking, you are correct, but then again you and NF2L do not either it is all just opinion until Mr. Green does commit and at that time whenever it is I hope he chooses NU, but I do believe at this time that if Texas was to push hard for him he will go there..and if Texas wanted him they would be recruiting him harder than what has been mentioned..I hope I am wrong but that is currently my opinion of this situation.

Daniel Davie, however, isn't sure that's a universal truth.

""""You can't just run straight in football. You have to have lateral movement and be able to see what's coming.""""

Davie won the all-class Gold medal in both the 100- and 200-meter races at the state track meet, turning in an electronic 10.74-second time in the 100 and :21.95 in the 200. He had a hand-held time of :10.4 earlier in the spring to move into a tie for fourth on the state's all-time charts.

Davie's speed on a football field hasn't gone unnoticed. He already committed to accept a Nebraska football scholarship. [B]Last fall, he was primarily a wide receiver and had more than 1,000 all-purpose yards for the Orangemen.[/B]

[B]""""It's a big difference for me this year. I was a deep threat last year, not a workhorse,"""" Davie said. """"I'll be playing running back and split out some this year.""""[/B]

""""My sophomore year, I played defense on varsity but I was playing running back in junior varsity every play, so I know what it's like,"""" he said. """"Last year, I was the third-down outside guy for runs. This year, running will be my primary duty.""""

""""I'll play whatever helps my team the most. In high school, moving around might make the defense off-balance more,"""" he said. """"But football is football. I'm a competitor and I try not to worry about who is hitting me and where.""""

Beatrice coach Bob Sexton said he also is aware of what an athlete like Davie can do for a team.

""""Obviously, he will present problems for opponents, so we just want to get the ball in his hands,"""" Sexton said. """"When a team has an outstanding athlete, you might try to scheme for him. Daniel will be all over the field.

Davie said he's looking forward to his senior season, particularly two games. On Sept. 17, Beatrice plays at defending champion Aurora, featuring Super-Stater Tyson Broekemeier. On Oct. 8, the Orangemen travel to Crete to play the Cardinals, with Ryne Reeves, another Husker recruit.

""""I've got both of those marked on my calendar. Reeves is a cool guy and I've gotten to know him pretty well,"""" Davie said. """"But that night, he's my enemy. I've also gotten to be good friends with Tyson, but it's the same thing with him as it is with Ryne.""""[/QUOTE]

Prized LSU QB recruit Zack Lee signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers for $5.25 Million moments before the deadline. Lee had been considered nearly unsignable due to his committment to LSU. He was already on campus and practicing. His agreement reportedly specifies that he give up football. He was the 28th pick of this year's first round.

Meanwhile, Clemson QB Kyle Parker signed with the Colorado Rockies for about $1.4 Million. It is not yet known if he agreed to give up football or not but my guess is he will be allowed back to Clemson for his senior year. Parker was the 26th pick in the first round.

For perspective, Bubba Starling has been projected as the 42nd pick by Baseball America in next years' draft. Keep in mind that this is a very early projection that will likely change many times before next year. The 42nd pick would probably be a first round supplemental pick.

[QUOTE]Tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins picks Washington over Texas Longhorns
Longhorns now turn attention to Cibolo Steele running back Malcolm Brown. Jaxon Shipley 

The Longhorns lost a recruiting battle Monday for one of the nation's top tight end prospects when Austin Seferian-Jenkins of Gig Harbor, Wash., elected to stay close to home and play for the University of Washington.

Texas hopes the same kind of home-state advantage works in its favor in the next recruiting battle looming on the horizon.

Seferian-Jenkins' announcement was not a surprise. After visiting the Texas campus on Aug. 6-7, he attended three Washington practices, most recently on Saturday.

His home is about 50 miles from the Washington campus, and he made his announcement in front of a pro-Huskies crowd at the Gig Harbor Yacht Club.

The 6-foot, 7-inch, 260-pound Seferian-Jenkins, who caught 62 passes for 1,152 yards and 11 touchdowns as a junior, is ranked as the nation's No. 1 tight end in the 2011 class by Rivals.com.

""""We're going to go get Rose Bowls and national championships,"""" he said after pulling a Washington cap and football from a silver bag. """"I firmly believe that.""""

Seferian-Jenkins would have been a bonus for what still appears to be a top-five class for Texas. But the Longhorns, who have 22 verbal pledges for 2011, now turn their attention to the player who has been their No. 1 target all along â€” running back Malcolm Brown of Cibolo Steele.

Brown is ranked No. 1 on the American-Statesman's Fabulous 55. After rushing for 2,170 yards and 33 touchdowns as a junior, the 6-1, 200-pounder is ranked by Rivals.com as the nation's top running back in the 2011 class and the 10th-best overall prospect.

Brown's final two schools are Texas and Alabama. He could make an announcement before Steele High's Aug. 28 opener against San Antonio Madison, because coach Mike Jenks would like to avoid distractions.[/QUOTE]

Green's production dipped a bit as a junior, but this guy still has some of the better feet, vision and natural running skills we have seen in recent classes. Has more than adequate size but will need to add more compacted bulk to increase in-line running strength and durability at the next level. Reaches top speed within steps and can stop-start and regain it as good as any. His ability to redirect and cutback on a dime is outstanding as well as his ability to run with his eyes and see the small creases open. Burst and quickness to daylight is excellent Near impossible to get a direct shot on at the high school level, particularly when he takes a deep handoff on draw plays. Simply does not gear down when cutting; balance and body control are excellent. Great pick and dart type of runner on the inside zone play who simply shreds defenses with outstanding lateral footwork and agility. Displays good hands out of the backfield and polished overall receiving skills. Is very dangerous in the screen game with his ability to transition upfield quickly and can line up in the slot and create mismatches on linebackers. Top-end speed is good not great; a bit of a short strider. Flashes a second gear but it's not in an upper-tier level as well. Our main concern is his lack of downhill power and yards after contact production. Certainly can make defenders miss but his ability to lower the shoulder, absorb the big hit and run between the tackles as a fulltime back is a question mark. Like to see him utilize his great downhill burst and get North more decisively out of his cuts; something he seemed to do more as a sophomore. All that said, Green is an extremely talented, electric type runner with some of the better big-play ability in this class. Could jump back to the head of most college running back's board with a big senior season.[/QUOTE]

I have seen that theory quite a bit with their friendship and the two dads. Obviously it has heated up on the boards now that Brown finally gave his verbal. The pitch from Texas has always been for Green/Brown to be like USC had with Lendale White and Reggie Bush. I guess Texas had given Green his space and Applewhite had to call to let him know what was going on. I am going to remain skeptical about Green ending up in Austin but that would be just fine.

[QUOTE]The Plant (Tampa, Fla.) senior, the No. 1 recruit in the country from the Class of 2011 according to MaxPreps.com, announced his commitment Wednesday afternoon to Florida State University. 

A 6-foot-2, 220 pound running back, defensive end and linebacker, Wilder has spent the summer yielding as many as 80 offers from Division I schools. 

Wilder said his decision came down to several factors. 

Proximity, being comfortable and running the football. [/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]The Texas high school athletic landscape was shaken up last month as the University Interscholastic League announced that the possibility of adding a Class 6A was being explored. 

So, what would a Class 6A potentially look like? 

TheOldCoach.com took a look at the 2010 enrollment figures used for the state's most recent alignment, while also adding in new schools which are anticipated to play varsity football in 2012 and placing them in the appropriate classification. 

The possibility of schools """"opting up"""" was included as well. 

The final numbers, after the schools were placed in order, wound up with the proposed new Class 6A potentially having 202 schools, with an enrollment break of 2,255 or more. 

Below is a hypothetical Class 6A realignment as proposed by the staff of TheOldCoach.com. The current enrollment number is listed on the left. 

* Indicates a projected opt-up school. [/QUOTE]

Have for years.  You build a new HS, but you demographics wind up being off a few years.  Parents fight redistricting to balance out.  We wound up with Klein Oak nearly (or actually) dropping to 4-A for a season or two when Klein Collins was built; now a few years later Oak is over crowded and is the largest HS enrollment in the district.

That 4-A drop hurt them very bad for a few years.  They even lost their top Baseball Coach due to it (he had nine former players in the major leagues).  They took it out on the School Board and got most of the members replaced.  Didn't really do anything different, but it sure shook up district politics and hence, the administration.

Other districts have similar issues.  I think Wylie where our august former third team QB graduated from went from 2A to 5A very quickly and then they built another school.

I suspect this proposal may be an idea to formalize a split in the two divisions in 5A in the playoffs; only it permanently splits them.  They take all the teams that qualify and put them in smaller or larger category.",3956,visible,0,11,0,a:0:{},0,,1282322293,19,1

Highlights:

[QUOTE]Point Loma High's Christian Heyward comes from a family of athletes.
Christian Heyward is not your garden-variety, beefy high school lineman.

For a 275-pound tackle, the Point Loma High senior is exceptionally quick, agile and mobile. Once the football is snapped, he seems to explode across the line of scrimmage.

Athletically gifted, the 6-foot-3 senior also plays varsity basketball, offering an inside scoring touch and ample vertical leap to crash the boards and even dunk on occasion.

It’s an attention-grabbing combination that’s prompted strong interest from college football recruiters. The list of suitors courting Heyward includes every Pac-10 school except Stanford, plus such notables as Miami, Arkansas, Oklahoma State and [B]Nebraska[/B].

“Because of his athleticism and quickness, there’s a lot of upside with Christian,” said Pointers coach Mike Hastings. “Right now, he’s enjoying the high school experience. So, he’s just starting to tap into his ability, learning how to use his talent and his body. In college, where he will be more full-time into what he’s doing, he’s only going to get bigger, faster and stronger.”

There’s certainly an athletic legacy in the Heyward lineage. Christian’s dad, Walter, played basketball at Point Loma Nazarene University, and his cousin, Jason Heyward, is the Atlanta Braves standout rookie right fielder. His uncle, Kenny Washington, played basketball at UCLA, scoring 26 points in the Bruins’ 98-83 win over Duke in the 1964 NCAA title game. Another cousin, Simone Heyward, is a pitcher on the LSU women’s softball team.

An All-Western League first-team selection on defense last season when the Pointers rode a six-game winning streak into the San Diego Section Division III final (a 20-14 loss to Cathedral Catholic), Heyward is scheduled for additional duty as a tight end this season.

“I’m comfortable there and want to contribute on offense, too,” said Heyward, who’s ranked as the nation’s 18th best prep defensive tackle by one Internet recruiting service. “My personal goals are to stay healthy and have a good final season. We did what we could to win last year, but it was a game where the team that had the ball last would win. The team goal is to get back in the final and win.”[/QUOTE]Much more here:

[QUOTE]08/09/2010

[B]On the Hoof:[/B] Very lean build with almost no body fat. He has the frame to add at least 15 more pounds of muscle mass. His build is similar to fellow Texan Lache Seastrunk.
 
[B]Needs Improvement:[/B] Watching the ball all the way into his hands before turning up field is a necessity if he is to have an impact in the passing game. Green must also prove he has the durability to become an every-down back at the next level. 

[B]Most Impressive:[/B] Has the ability to change directions on a dime while reaching top speed in a blink of an eye. Green's speed makes him a homerun threat from any point on the field. His skill set could make him a threat as a return man in the kicking game. 

[B]Conclusion:[/B] Look for Green to get early looks as a return man in the kicking game. If he proves to have the toughness and smarts to pick up different blitzes he could also see time in long-yardage situations. If he stays healthy, he should become a star in the long run wherever he goes because of his sickening explosiveness.[/QUOTE]

Great post, barring any de-commits, this will be one of the better classes we have seen at NU(before they get here) in my mind. Does that mean the will pan out? Did the 2005 class pan out? I think will start seeing the fruition of great recruiting and great coaching from top to bottom.

[QUOTE]No. 28: RB Aaron Green
5-11/191, San Antonio (Texas) James Madison 
[B]Why he's close:[/B] Green may be the most explosive back in the country. He is nearly impossible for defensive backs to cover and can make defenders whiff in the open field. He is a serious home-run threat with the skills of a potential kick and punt returner. 

[B]Why he's not there:[/B] He needs to become a more consistent pass catcher. At times he allows the ball to get to his body and struggles adjusting while the ball is in the air. If a back can't catch passes like a receiver, he won't play on every down. [/QUOTE]

Oh I definitely agree about homefield in Lincoln. That will be a toughie for sure. Just hard to speculate too much about that game 7 weeks away not knowing how the Texas offense will respond to the Tech and OU challenges. 

Tech plays Texas out of their minds in Lubbock. I think Mack is 6-0 against Tech in Austin and 3-3 in Lubbock. A couple of those losses Texas took top 5 teams in and all three times victories in Lubbock would have meant a South title that didn't happen.

Yeah I just find it interesting with Cash that he would even consider looking around unless he isn't hearing what he wants to hear or OSU is telling him to look around due to class size or something (which I kinda doubt based on his skill). I won't consider your prediction wild if he chooses to come here! ;) The great thing I keep reading about Cash and Lyons is how they are both rover types with the ability to play S - uhm, sounds exactly like the abilities BP is lookin for! 

Also I haven't seen as much video on Mickey as I have on Peat, so I'm a little biased here, but Peat fires off the ball like mad and seems to be in the backfield more than he isn't. Based on rankings, I would assume Mickey is darn good and we should hope to get him as well - he seems to be in the Jay Guy mold (continually described as a tank).

Yeah, all of this is just speculation and I'm no mind-reader, but everything I've read on Hobbi just makes it seem like he wants to stay in the SW. Once again, hope I'm wrong, but we've got a good looking OLine class so far!",4386,visible,0,8,0,a:0:{},0,,0,0,0

MY gut feels the same way.

I think he did not want to be rushed so he told Texas he was going to take his time and decide.  I think Texas wanted to take 2 RB, #1 being Brown and #2 blieve one of 3 or 4 other backs which included Green.  One of those """"other"""" backs committed to Texas.  Green than may have wanted to but was told the spot is Brown's first, so he had to first wait on Brown.  Then after Brown committed, Green narrows his list to 2-3 school Cal, NU and FSU.  I think Texas has targets for the last 1 or 2 schollie thay have and come late January if Texas does not get those targets they will make a hard pusj for Green...and then that is when we see where he real wants to go.  I think if Texas completely fills up before Late January we will see Green commit somewhere shorty after that, but I think he is waiting to see how the Texas scholie numbers play out.

I hope he chooses NU, but right now I still think we are in the group of second choices along with Cal and FSU.  

NOTE this is all just my opinion I have no inside info, just my 2 cents and anyone reading this may want a 3 cent refund :D

Certainly cannot comment on what goes on in other districts, especially how they decide to spend their money, although textbooks are provide by and paid for by the state of Texas.  Our district from time to time has had problems receiving enough textbooks but eventually it works out. Knowing many dedicated teachers, I would hope the math teacher would feel a responsibility to make sure all his/her students learn the curriculum and important concepts.  That is what they are paid to do.  You want those kids participating in something that is meaningful to them and teaches a few life lessons along the way.  For many that is athletics.

I would like to think that would help our chances with them getting a commit from Wilder. Also states that right now he really just wants to focus on his senior season. I wish him luck! Especially this weekend as he faces off against Malcom Brown!

All Big Ten games are televised live.....ESPN and ESPN2 always have 2 games at 11 am and then the other games start at different times and they have the main channel and 5 or so alternate channels so you can watch whatever game you want as 2-3 or more are going on at the same time.

[QUOTE]Evaluation

Russell Shepard 2.0, 2011 edition. [B]Turner is one of the most exciting skilled athletes this class has to offer.[/B] He is a dual-threat QB out of the shotgun spread, but [B]most of the damage he does is with his legs.[/B] With the reference to Shepard-- his style, throwing motion and skill set is almost a mirror image. He is a lean and sleak player with good height. [B]He is a special athlete with all the movement skills you look for in a game breaker. Turner is one of the most explosive and speedy players in the athlete class. His run skills are outstanding out of the spread and he is a zone-read nightmare. His ability to exploit cutback lanes and tiny creases with burst and acceleration is impressive. He reaches top speed rapidly and can stop and start on dime and is a big play guy on the perimeter. Has eyes in the back of his head with jump-cut ability that is out of sight. Can go from full speed, to dead top back to full speed in the blink of an eye.[/B] His body control, balance and agility to keep his feet are all excellent. He is a smooth athlete with quick hips and he has the frame to be a strong player at both wide receiver and cornerback. As a passer would need to be in the spread to have a chance to stay at QB. Has a relatively smooth and quick delivery. Flicks the ball and is more of an improvisational passer. Will show some zip on underneath throws and can fit balls into some tight spots in the short range. Throws the ball well on the move especially to his right. Has good touch and timing on the deep ball. [B]The reality is that Turner is too good an athlete to invest too much time in to develop as a passer when he could be on the field making an impact at another position offensively or on defense.[/B] Overall, it is hard to imagine there are many guys in this class that possess all of Turner's athletic traits and we feel he could blow up into a national recruit throughout his senior year. [B]Excellent prospect that we feel will end up at WR or CB/S[/B].... [/QUOTE]

Daniel Davie-Beatrice
I’m having difficulty finding Davie’s stats, so here are his summaries in the article:
[QUOTE]Nebraska recruit Daniel Davie rushed for 119 yards and two touchdowns, turned a short swing pass from quarterback Tandon Dorn into a 65-yard touchdown, and he intercepted a pass to lead Beatrice.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Davie picked up a pair of blocks, cut once to his right, then back to the left sideline and pulled away from Norris defenders with ease in the final 40-yard sprint to the end zone. The touchdown came on the fifth play of the second half and boosted Beatrice's lead to 21-7.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE]The Orangemen answered quickly on their first possession as Davie sparked a six-play scoring drive with 47 yards rushing on four carries, including the final 9 on a twisting, cutback run. On Beatrice's next possession, Davie added the 65-yard touchdown that capped a 73-yard drive.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Beatrice took control when Davie scored on a 35-yard run on the opening possession of the second half. That run also featured the cutback style and the speed to slip through a seam.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. -- Police arrested two Central Gwinnett High School football players and charged them with forgery, after police said the players used counterfeit $10 bills at the school's bookstore.

School police reports said Malcolm Alvin Moulton, 17, and Daryle Davon Wesley, 18, used $30 in counterfeit bills on Monday to make a purchase at the book store. The two were arrested and charged with first-degree forgery, a felony.

A teammate, running back Diante Drake, was arrested Aug. 4 and charged with marijuana possession, his second such charge in nine months.

Moulton is a wide receiver and Wesley a linebacker.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]CLEARWATER — The wind swirled around the stadium, carrying the first signs of winter.

The Class 5A region final was played in a steady rain on a sloppy field Dec. 4 against defending state champion Plant.

Mud was smeared across uniforms, and no players were muddier than the offensive linemen,  who wear turf and sweat as badges of honor.

“The traction was a little tough, and it was a mess out there,” Countryside offensive tackle Tyler Moore said. “It was kind of nasty and not all that much fun to play in.”

The Cougars lost the game, but [B]Moore won his own personal battle in the trenches. On every snap, he urgently plowed toward the end zone as if a buffet line awaited every score.[/B]

[B]Moore was lined up against Plant linebacker James Wilder Jr.,  considered one of the nation’s top recruits. On a few plays, Wilder was left overturned, on his back, in what is known as a pancake block.[/B]

[B]“(Wilder) didn’t talk to me too much during the game,” Moore said. “But I saw him a few months after that at a combine, and he said that is the most he’s ever been manhandled in a game.”[/B]

Last season, the Cougars, who reached the region final for just the second time in school history, built momentum largely on the sturdy back of Moore and his fellow offensive linemen. Running back Alton Taylor set a school record with more than 1,900 yards rushing and a county record with 30 touchdowns.

[B]“The offensive line is the most important part of the football team,” Moore said. “You need to be able to run the ball and you need to be able to protect the quarterback.[/B]

“It all starts up front.”

No part of a football team is designed to work in such synchronicity as the offensive line, and nearly every team’s fortunes are dependent on how well that unit is put together. Of the county teams that made deep runs into the playoffs last year, nearly all of them had one thing in common, a solid offensive line that had been together for at least a year, an eternity for such a unit.

“A good offensive line is absolutely essential, especially at this level because the running game is so important,” Countryside coach Jared Davis said.

If offensive linemen had a say, they would run the ball, again and again, and then run it some more. It is difficult, if not impossible, to find an offensive lineman who would rather pass block than run block. If allowed to call the plays, every snap would be followed by a grunting forward surge.

But great offenses do not just run the ball. They throw it, too. To create that balance, a team needs a dependable left tackle.

The Cougars have it with Moore, who is considered one of the best in the country. The 6-foot-6, 280-pound senior had offers from nearly every major Division-I program [B]before committing to Nebraska last fall.[/B]

“I feel pretty fortunate that I come into my first year as a coach [B]and I get to work with probably the best offensive lineman I’m ever going to have,” Davis said. “Tyler’s not just about putting his hand on the ground and moving people. He’s a great person with a strong work ethic. He’s the total package.”[/B]

Linemen are a largely anonymous group. Taylor, for example, was candidate for county player of the year honors.

But Moore has made a name for himself, due in large part to his size — and performance. He will be counted on to keep the Cougars in playoff contention after they lost three linemen and Taylor to graduation. Moore and fellow tackle Tyler Pierson are the only returning starters on the line.

[B]“I worked really hard in the weight room, the field, everywhere to get ready for this season and prepare for college,”[/B] Moore said. “We don’t want any drop-off, and we want to go as far as we did last year.”[/QUOTE]

132593,6278,369,HuskerInOkieland,1284683588,"Clicked onto the Baseball America website and there to my surprise was a picture of Bubba Starling and a feature story on him. The article is titled """"In Demand"""" and the caption below the picture states """"Bubba Starling could be a first-round draft pick in next year's draft."""" The teaser also goes on to say he has five-tool ability and is one of the top talents in next year's draft.

The article is reserved for subscribed readers (although it will be printed in a future addition of the magazine). It states much of which we already know, he is perhaps the top two-way player in the draft. By two-way, they mean he can pitch or play outfield. He is 6'5"""" with blazing speed. He is also a star basketball player to boot. This guy is starting to remind me of Josh Hamilton who had very much the same profile (and ironically was drafted one round ahead of Carl Crawford in the same draft by the same team.)

He talks about playing two sports at NU and how great the coaching staffs are.

This kid is a special talent. I don't know if he will end up here or not. But at least NU should receive some nice pub along the way even if he doesn't.",5356,visible,0,0,0,a:0:{},0,,0,0,0
